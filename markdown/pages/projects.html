<p>This is my current project, a rendering engine utilizing the OpenGL API, written in C++. Current features – Shader System, Camera System, rendering for 2D and 3D primitives, batch rendering.</p>
<p><strong><em>Images coming soon!</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.vg/RCON">RCON</a> is a TCP/IP-based protocol that allows server administrators to remotely execute Minecraft commands.</p>
<p>I wrote this program to help with my Minecraft server administration. It’s very convenient to be able to send commands remotely to my Ubuntu server, and I added a simple GUI using PyQt6!</p>

<h3 id="glautomata---conways-game-of-life"><a href="https://github.com/Karsteski/Glautomata"><strong>Glautomata - Conway’s Game of Life</strong></a></h3>
<p>John Conway’s Game of Life displayed using batch rendering in OpenGL.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead.</li>
<li>Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.</li>
<li>At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
<ol type="1">
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This creates complex patterns from very simple rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided on a whim one day to apply my OpenGL learning to one of my favourite things to code, the game of life! It runs a lot better than my first implementation of it, which just used the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGUI library</a> to leverage a rendering API <em>(OpenGL in this case as well)</em> to draw to the screen. However, batch rendering, i.e. sending all the vertex data simultaneously per draw call proved to be a far more efficient method.</p>
<p>I’m quite proud of the code, despite it being a small project, as its pretty clean in my opinion.</p>

<h3 id="cellular-automata-generator"><a href="https://github.com/Karsteski/The_Cellular_Automata"><strong>Cellular Automata Generator</strong></a></h3>
<p>This is a generator for Elementary Cellular Automata and John Conway’s Game of Life. Inspired by Stephen Wolfram’s 2002 book: A New Kind of Science.</p>
<p>The cellular automata generator took me quite a while to get right. It was my first time trying to do something a bit complicated in C++, but I learnt quite a lot, and my second time around (<em>See Glautomata above</em>) had the code be much cleaner and maintainable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elementary Cellular Automata are the simplest class of one-dimensional cellular atomata.</li>
<li>Each cell in a grid has two possible values (0 or 1) and rules that depend on their previous three nearest neighbours.</li>
<li>In this program, different automata can be generated simply by changing an 8-bit binary number that represents the rules for what each cell’s state should be given it’s neighbours.</li>
