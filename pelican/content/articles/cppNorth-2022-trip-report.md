Hello people, I'm Kareem a new C++ developer at [Christie Digital](https://www.christiedigital.com/). I'm quite new to software developer in general, as I worked at getting better at programming for a number of years whilst working as a chemist. I signed up to be a volunteer at the CppNorth conference earlier in the year, which I then had to reneg on due to starting my aforementioned job, not wanting to take several days off barely a month in. Luckily and thankfully, my manager was okay with me attending as a volunteer, so I was able to attend my first C++ conference ever!

As a volunteer, our duties were mostly simply to ensure the ancillary parts of the conference ran smoothly, such as the registration table, the timing of the speakers and ensuring the closed captions for each talk were set up. I arrived in Toronto by train from Stratford, Ontario on the Sunday of the conference, so I unfortunately was unable to weekend workshops. Still, I was happy to be able to help out with the large number of people at the registration table that day.

With respect to the accommodations, the Omni King Edward hotel staff were great and quite helpful. It was certainly the fanciest hotel I've ever stayed at, not that I have much experience with that sort of thing. That being said, I was quite happy that the hotel had quite a reasonable gym for all guests to use and that there was always (expensive but good) food available.

In terms of the conference itself, the attendees were quite friendly and very open to casual conversation. My fellow volunteers were equally amicable and on the Sunday I got to enjoy some fun games of [Dixit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixit_(card_game)) with them and a few attendees. The board games were for sure a great idea, and I'd definitely like them to make a return.

On to some of the talks I was able to attend at the conference:

### **Day 1**

#### *Opening Keynote: Kate Gregory - "Am I a Good Programmer?"*

In the opening keynote, Kate talks about the idea of the metrics people use to determine whether they are good programmers. She noted that measures such as years of employment, age or [large amounts of GitHub contributions]({projects.md}/../../images/articles/cppnorth-2022-trip-report/github-contribution-activity.png) were poor metrics of "a good programmer". I found that one of the strongest points made was that the ceation of long term maintainable code were strong signs of a good programmer. I will certainly keep this in mind for the decades to come.

Kate Gregory herself is a lady that I've looked up to for years. She has helped me out personally in the [#include <C++> discord](https://www.includecpp.org/discord/) that I have been a part of ever since I began my journey into learning C++ and software development in general. I was quite glad to be able to finally meet someone whose talks and advice I've kept in mind for a quite a while now!

#### *Patrice Roy - Programming for Warm Days: Avoiding Dangerous Conversions*

In this code-heavy session, Patrice demonstrates how one would convert between units of Celsius and Farenheit whilst maintaining type safety and avoiding the use of macros.
