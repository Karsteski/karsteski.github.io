Summary: "About Me" page for Karsteski.com

Hey funny seeing you here. I'm Kareem and welcome to my personal website. I felt like having a website so here we are.

I'm a Trinidadian who moved to Ontario, Canada for university in 2014, and now I (hopefully) live here permanently. I did my B.Sc. in Chemistry, yet you are probably wondering why I'm so into programming now. I always loved tinkering with things since I was a child. I'd sometimes open up toys just to see how they worked, or I'd stick random things together to build something new, like a boat out of wood with a random motor I had along with a [wooden ice cream stick]({about.md}/../../images/about/ice-cream-sticks.jpg). Were they good? **Hell no**. But they were fun to play around with. Point being I've always loved creating and building things, hence why both chemistry and programming appealed to me.

Turns out, most chemistry jobs aren't so much creating, but just testing products, pharmaceuticals, what have you. Which is what I'm currently doing now (QC Chemistry). Thankfully in 2018 one of my friends introduced me to Arduino microcontrollers, which is where I properly got interested in programming. I started off with C++ because I wanted to learn more about the "Arduino language", and later started learning Python and some SQL.

Now I work at [Christie Digital](https://www.christiedigital.com/) with <u>wicked smart</u><sup>TM</sup> people and very much enjoying life!

Anyways, when I'm not destroying my eyes staring at text, I really enjoy gaming, hiking, camping, weightlifting and reading. I'd also like to get back into Jiu Jitsu at some point as well (I was a complete newb, ngl).

So I set up this website mainly to motivate me to start writing blog posts. I've realized I'd like to get better at putting my thoughts into concrete words, and what better way to force myself to do it?
