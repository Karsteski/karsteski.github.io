        <section id="about">
            <p>Hey funny seeing you here. I’m Kareem and welcome to my personal website. I felt like having a website so
                here we are.</p>
            <p>I’m a Trinidadian who moved to Ontario, Canada for university in 2014, and now I (hopefully) live here
                permanently. I did my B.Sc. in Chemistry, yet you are probably wondering why I’m so into programming
                now. I always loved tinkering with things since I was a child. I’d sometimes open up toys just to see
                how they worked, or I’d stick random things together to build something new, like a boat out of wood
                with a random motor I had along with a <a href="/../../images/about/ice-cream-sticks.jpg">wooden ice
                    cream stick</a>. Were they good? <strong>Hell no</strong>. But they were fun to play around with.
                Point being I’ve always loved creating and building things, hence why both chemistry and programming
                appealed to me.</p>
            <p>Turns out, most chemistry jobs aren’t so much creating, but just testing products, pharmaceuticals, what
                have you. Which is what I’m currently doing now (QC Chemistry). Thankfully in 2018 one of my friends
                introduced me to Arduino microcontrollers, which is where I properly got interested in programming. I
                started off with C++ because I wanted to learn more about the “Arduino language”, and later started
                learning Python and some SQL.</p>
            <p>I’m now searching for my first developer job! It’s definitely an uphill battle but I’m confident I will
                make it, it’s only a matter of time now.</p>
            <p>Anyways, when I’m not destroying my eyes staring at text, I really enjoy gaming, hiking, camping,
                weightlifting and reading. I’d also like to get back into Jiu Jitsu at some point as well (I was a
                complete newb, ngl).</p>
            <p>So I set up this website mainly to motivate me to start writing blog posts. I’ve realized I’d like to get
                better at putting my thoughts into concrete words, and what better way to force myself to do it. My
                up-to-date resume and other sections of information will also be on here, so feel free to look around.
                Enjoy :)</p>

                    href="https://github.com/Karsteski/Glautomata"><strong>Glautomata - Conway’s Game of
                        Life</strong></a></h3>
            <p>John Conway’s Game of Life displayed using batch rendering in OpenGL.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is
                    in one of two possible states, alive or dead.</li>
                <li>Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally,
                    vertically, or diagonally adjacent.</li>
                <li>At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation</li>
                        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation</li>
                        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation</li>
                        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>This creates complex patterns from very simple rules.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I decided on a whim one day to apply my OpenGL learning to one of my favourite things to code, the game
                of life! It runs a lot better than my first implementation of it, which just used the <a
                    href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGUI library</a> to leverage a rendering API
                <em>(OpenGL in this case as well)</em> to draw to the screen. However, batch rendering, i.e. sending all
                the vertex data simultaneously per draw call proved to be a far more efficient method.
            </p>
            <p>I’m quite proud of the code, despite it being a small project, as its pretty clean in my opinion.</p>

                    href="https://github.com/Karsteski/The_Cellular_Automata"><strong>Cellular Automata
                        Generator</strong></a></h3>
            <p>This is a generator for Elementary Cellular Automata and John Conway’s Game of Life. Inspired by Stephen
                Wolfram’s 2002 book: A New Kind of Science.</p>
            <p>The cellular automata generator took me quite a while to get right. It was my first time trying to do
                something a bit complicated in C++, but I learnt quite a lot, and my second time around (<em>See
                    Glautomata above</em>) had the code be much cleaner and maintainable.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Elementary Cellular Automata are the simplest class of one-dimensional cellular atomata.</li>
                <li>Each cell in a grid has two possible values (0 or 1) and rules that depend on their previous three
                    nearest neighbours.</li>
                <li>In this program, different automata can be generated simply by changing an 8-bit binary number that
                    represents the rules for what each cell’s state should be given it’s neighbours.</li>
